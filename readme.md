# SpotMON

This project is scaffolding for a project I'm working on called SpotMON. It's job is just to watch SPOT API feeds and run sanity checks,
and send notifications when things update. 

## SPOT Sharing Page Configuration
Here is the ideal setup if you plan on using this:

 * Make sure that the sharing page is public (meaning no password).
 * Only setup one tracker per sharing page.
 * Uncheck all points other than "tracking"
 * Only show the past 24 hours of points.
